        <h2><u>History of Weapons</u></h2>
        <p>The history of weapons is vast and spans over thousands of years, reflecting the evolution of technology, warfare, and societal changes.<br> Here's a brief overview of key milestones in the history of weapons:
         <hr>
         <h3><b> <u>Ancient Weapons (Prehistoric to ~500 AD):</u></b></h3>
          
            <h4>Stone Tools: </h4>
            Early humans used simple tools made of stone, such as hand axes and spears, for hunting and self-defense.

            <h4>Bow and Arrow: </h4>
            The invention of the bow and arrow revolutionized hunting and warfare, providing a means for projectile-based attacks.

            <h4>Swords and Axes:</h4>
            As societies developed metalworking skills, swords and axes became common weapons in various cultures, such as the Bronze Age civilizations of Mesopotamia and ancient Egypt.

            <h4>Catapults and Siege Weapons:</h4> 
            Ancient armies used siege weapons like catapults and battering rams for assaulting fortified structures.<br>

               <h4>Longbows and Crossbows:</h4>
               Improved ranged weapons, such as the longbow and crossbow, played significant roles in medieval warfare.

               <h4>Plate Armor and Polearms:</h4>
               Advances in armor led to the use of plate armor by knights, and polearms like halberds and pikes became popular infantry weapons.

               <h4>Gunpowder and Firearms:</h4>
               The invention of gunpowder in China eventually led to the development of firearms. The first recorded use of firearms in battle occurred in the 14th century.<br>
